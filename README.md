# spring
Here I have some POC projects related different modules of Spring

# SpringBoot

# You can also run the H2-Console on the browser
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
Use db url jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
Where is the database created?
In Memory - Using H2
Can I see the data in the database?
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
Use db url jdbc:h2:mem:testdb

# Magic of Spring Boot and in Memory Database
Zero project setup or infrastructure
Zero Configuration
Zero Maintainance
Easy to use for Learning and Unit Tests
Simple Configuration to switch to a real database

# Restrictions of using inmemory database
Data is not persisted between restarts
